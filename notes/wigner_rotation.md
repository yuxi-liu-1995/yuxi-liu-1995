**[Geometric derivation of Wigner rotation](http://yuxi-liu-1995.github.io/files/notes/wigner_rotation/wigner_rotation_complete.pdf)**

Report written in 2018 for PHYS3001 course at Australian National University.

**Abstract**
----
The [Wigner Rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner_rotation) describes the paradoxical phenomenon in special relativity, where a composition of several [Lorentz boosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation) could give a pure rotation. Despite having important applications, as well as being an extremely surprising paradox, it is rarely taught in undergraduate physics, and its geometric meaning is rarely mentioned anywhere.

This paper gives an illustrated derivation of Wigner rotation using the geometry of spacetime diagrams, assuming no background in the reader of the geometric style of reasoning about special relativity. This allows Wigner rotation to be easily derived and its geometric meaning understood, allowing it to be taught in an introductory course on special relativity. The [Thomas precession formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_precession) becomes an easy corollary. Illustrative fables and further readings are attached at the end.
