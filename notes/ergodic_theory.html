<h2 id="abstract"><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
<p>This paper gives an illustrated overview of several areas in dynamical systems. We start with Poincare’s discovery of chaos in the three-body problem, and define the Poincare section method for studying dynamical systems. Then we discuss the long-term behavior of iterating a diffeomorphism in R^n around a fixed point, and obtain the concept of hyperbolicity. Then we give the Arnold cat map as a classical example of hyperbolic map, and prove its hyperbolicity. Then we introduce homoclinic tangles and discover Smale’s horseshoe in it. Then we prove that the behavior of the Smale horseshoe is the same as the binary shift, reducing the problem to symbolic dynamics. We conclude with applications to physics. The target audience is beginning graduate students in mathematics.</p>
